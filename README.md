Digital Conversation Cards

## Description

I'm listening is a set of conversation cards meant to act as ice breakers and conversational topics during meetings or just between friends.
A single round has 7 cards with questions from Macalester's Idea Lab Student Staff. Each time a new session is started, 7 new cards are picked from a total pool of 66 cards.

### Using Cards

The cards are available for use on this [link](https:/imlistening.glitch.me)
